# flashcards-jbrains
When learning a new language, it can be hard to remember all the new vocabulary, which is exactly where flashcards can help. Typically, flashcards show a hint (a task or a picture) on one side and the right answer on the other. Flashcards can be used to remember any sort of data.

Project Description:
Welcome to the Flashcards-JBrains repository! This project aims to create a versatile flashcards application designed to aid language learners in memorizing new vocabulary effectively. Flashcards are a powerful tool for retaining information, and this application offers a user-friendly interface to help users remember various types of data.

Features:

Flashcard Creation: The application allows users to create flashcards with a hint or task on one side and the corresponding right answer on the other. Users can customize flashcards for different purposes, such as language vocabulary, mathematical equations, historical events, and more.

Deck Management: Users can organize their flashcards into decks, making it easy to group related content and access specific topics.

Flashcard Review: The application includes a flashcard review mode where users can flip through their created flashcards to practice and reinforce their learning.

Randomized Practice: Users can opt for randomized flashcard practice to challenge their memory and ensure a comprehensive understanding of the content.

Progress Tracking: The application tracks the user's progress by keeping count of the flashcards reviewed and the correct answers given, providing feedback on the learning journey.
